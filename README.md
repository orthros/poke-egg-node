# poke-egg-node
A rework of poke-egg-solver using node.js
poke-egg-solver can be found here:

```
https://github.com/orthros/poke-egg-solver
```

Uses ExpressJS via Node to programmatically create a set of routes to service the requests in a REST-ful manner.

Once the request is received, the application will parse the given arguments (via the url) and pass them on to the solver (found in solver.js)
